For more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.8+ is required to use this package.\n- [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)\n\n### Install the package\n\n```bash\npip install azure-mgmt-billing\npip install azure-identity\n```\n\n### Authentication\n\nBy default, [Azure Active Directory](https://aka.ms/awps/aad) token authentication depends on correct configure of following environment variables.\n\n- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` for Azure client ID.\n- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` for Azure tenant ID.\n- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` for Azure client secret.\n\nIn addition, Azure subscription ID can be configured via environment variable `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.\n\nWith above configuration, client can be authenticated by following code:\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\nfrom azure.mgmt.billing import BillingManagementClient\nimport os\n\nsub_id = os.getenv(\"AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID\")\nclient = BillingManagementClient(credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id=sub_id)\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nCode samples for this package can be found at:\n- [Search Billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com\n- [Azure Python Mgmt SDK Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n## Next steps\n\n## Provide Feedback\n\nIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the\n[Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)\nsection of the project. \n\n\n# Release History\n\n## 7.0.0 (2024-09-04)\n\n### Features Added\n\n  -

`azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/\n  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`\n\n- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)\n- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead\n- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.\n- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).\n- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:\n\n  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user\n  - For a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)\n\n**General new features**\n\n- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.\n- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.\n- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.\n\n## 1.0.0 (2020-10-19)\n\n**Features**\n\n  - Model
