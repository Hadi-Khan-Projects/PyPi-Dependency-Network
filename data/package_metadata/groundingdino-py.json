Each box has similarity scores across all input words. (as shown in Figures below.)\n- We defaultly choose the boxes whose highest similarities are higher than a `box_threshold`.\n- We extract the words whose similarities are higher than the `text_threshold` as predicted labels.\n- If you want to obtain objects of specific phrases, like the `dogs` in the sentence `two dogs with a stick.`, you can select the boxes with highest text similarities with `dogs` as final outputs.\n- Note that each word can be split to **more than one** tokens with different tokenlizers. The number of words in a sentence may not equal to the number of text tokens.\n- We suggest separating different category names with `.` for Grounding DINO.\n  ![model_explain1](.asset/model_explan1.PNG)\n  ![model_explain2](.asset/model_explan2.PNG)\n\n## :label: TODO\n\n- [x] Release inference code and demo.\n- [x] Release checkpoints.\n- [x] Grounding DINO with Stable Diffusion and GLIGEN demos.\n- [ ] Release training codes.\n\n## :hammer_and_wrench: Install\n\n**Note:**\n\nIf you have a CUDA environment, please make sure the environment variable `CUDA_HOME` is set.
