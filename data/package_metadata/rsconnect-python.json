This is also used by the\n[`rsconnect-jupyter`](https://github.com/rstudio/rsconnect-jupyter) package to deploy\nJupyter notebooks via the Jupyter web console. Many types of content supported by Posit\nConnect may be deployed by this package, including WSGI-style APIs, Dash, Streamlit,\nGradio, and Bokeh applications.\n\nContent types not directly supported by the CLI may also be deployed if they include a\nprepared `manifest.json` file. See [\"Deploying R or Other\nContent\"](#deploying-r-or-other-content) for details.\n\n\n### Installation\n\nTo install `rsconnect-python` from PYPI, you may use any python package manager such as\npip:\n\n```bash\npip install rsconnect-python\n```\n\nYou may also build and install a wheel directly from a repository clone:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/posit-dev/rsconnect-python.git\ncd rsconnect-python\npip install pipenv\nmake dist\npip install ./dist/rsconnect_python-*.whl\n```\n\n### Using the rsconnect CLI\n\nHere's an example command that deploys a Jupyter notebook to Posit Connect.\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy notebook \\\n    --server https://connect.example.org \\\n    --api-key my-api-key \\\n    my-notebook.ipynb\n```\n\n> **Note**\n> The examples here use long command line options, but there are short\n> options (`-s`, `-k`, etc.) available also. Run `rsconnect deploy notebook --help`\n> for details.\n\n### Setting up `rsconnect` CLI auto-completion\n\nIf you would like to use your shell's tab completion support with the `rsconnect`\ncommand, use the command below for the shell you are using.\n\n#### `bash`\n\nIf you are using the `bash` shell, use this to enable tab completion.\n\n```bash\n#~/.bashrc\neval \"$(_RSCONNECT_COMPLETE=source rsconnect)\"\n```\n\n#### `zsh`\n\nIf you are using the `zsh` shell, use this to enable tab completion.\n\n```zsh\n#~/.zshrc\neval \"$(_RSCONNECT_COMPLETE=source_zsh rsconnect)\"\n```\n\nIf you get `command not found: compdef`, you need to add the following lines to your\n`.zshrc` before the completion setup:\n\n```zsh\n#~/.zshrc\nautoload -Uz compinit\ncompinit\n```\n\n### Managing Server Information\n\nThe information used by the `rsconnect` command to communicate with a Posit Connect\nserver can be tedious to repeat on every command. To help, the CLI supports the idea\nof saving this information, making it usable by a simple nickname.\n\n> **Warning**\n> One item of information saved is the API key used to authenticate with\n> Posit Connect. Although the file where this information is saved is marked as\n> accessible by the owner only, it's important to remember that the key is present\n> in the file as plain text so care must be taken to prevent any unauthorized access\n> to the server information file.\n\n#### TLS Support and Posit Connect\n\nUsually, a Posit Connect server will be set up to be accessed in a secure manner,\nusing the `https` protocol rather than simple `http`. If Posit Connect is set up\nwith a self-signed certificate, you will need to include the `--insecure` flag on\nall commands. If Posit Connect is set up to require a client-side certificate chain,\nyou will need to include the `--cacert` option that points to your certificate\nauthority (CA) trusted certificates file. Both of these options can be saved along\nwith the URL and API Key for a server.\n\n> **Note**\n> When certificate information is saved for the server, the specified file\n> is read and its _contents_ are saved under the server's nickname. If the CA file's\n> contents are ever changed, you will need to add the server information again.\n\nSee the [Network Options](#network-options) section for more details about these options.\n\n#### Remembering Server Information\n\nUse the `add` command to store information about a Posit Connect server:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect add \\\n    --api-key my-api-key \\\n    --server https://connect.example.org \\\n    --name myserver\n```\n\n> **Note**\n> The `rsconnect` CLI will verify that the serve URL and API key\n> are valid. If either is found not to be, no information will be saved.\n\nIf any of the access information for the server changes, simply rerun the\n`add` command with the new information and it will replace the original\ninformation.\n\nOnce the server's information is saved, you can refer to it by its nickname:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy notebook --name myserver my-notebook.ipynb\n```\n\nIf there is information for only one server saved, this will work too:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy notebook my-notebook.ipynb\n```\n\n#### Listing Server Information\n\nYou can see the list of saved server information with:\n\n```\nrsconnect list\n```\n\n#### Removing Server Information\n\nYou can remove information about a server with:\n\n```\nrsconnect remove --name myserver\n```\n\nRemoving may be done by its nickname (`--name`) or URL (`--server`).\n\n### Verifying Server Information\n\nYou can verify that a URL refers to a running instance of Posit Connect by using\nthe `details` command:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect details --server https://connect.example.org\n```\n\nIn this form, `rsconnect` will only tell you whether the URL given does, in fact, refer\nto a running Posit Connect instance. If you include a valid API key:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect details --server https://connect.example.org --api-key my-api-key\n```\n\nthe tool will provide the version of Posit Connect (if the server is configured to\ndivulge that information) and environmental information including versions of Python\nthat are installed on the server.\n\nYou can also use nicknames with the `details` command if you want to verify that the\nstored information is still valid.\n\n### Notebook Deployment Options\n\nThere are a variety of options available to you when deploying a Jupyter notebook to\nPosit Connect.\n\n#### Including Extra Files\n\nYou can include extra files in the deployment bundle to make them available when your\nnotebook is run by the Posit Connect server. Just specify them on the command line\nafter the notebook file:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy notebook my-notebook.ipynb data.csv\n```\n\n#### Package Dependencies\n\nIf a `requirements.txt` file exists in the same directory as the notebook file, it will\nbe included in the bundle. It must specify the package dependencies needed to execute\nthe notebook. Posit Connect will reconstruct the Python environment using the\nspecified package list.\n\nIf there is no `requirements.txt` file or the `--force-generate` option is specified,\nthe package dependencies will be determined from the current Python environment, or\nfrom an alternative Python executable specified via the `--python` option:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy notebook --python /path/to/python my-notebook.ipynb\n```\n\nYou can see the packages list that will be included by running `pip list --format=freeze` yourself,\nensuring that you use the same Python that you use to run your Jupyter Notebook:\n\n```bash\n/path/to/python -m pip list --format=freeze\n```\n\n#### Python Version\n\nWhen deploying Python content to Posit Connect,\nthe server will require matching `<MAJOR.MINOR>` versions of Python. For example,\na server with only Python 3.9 installed will fail to match content deployed with\nPython 3.8. Your administrator may also enable exact Python version matching which\nwill be stricter and require matching major, minor, and patch versions. For more\ninformation see the [Posit Connect Admin Guide chapter titled Python Version\nMatching](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/python/#python-version-matching).\n\nWe recommend installing a version of Python on your client that is also available\nin your Connect installation. If that's not possible, you can override\nrsconnect-python's detected Python version and request a version of Python\nthat is installed in Connect, For example, this command:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy api --override-python-version 3.11.5 my-api/\n```\n\nwill deploy the content in `my-api` while requesting that Connect\nuse Python version 3.11.5.\n\n> **Note**\n> The packages and package versions listed in `requirements.txt` must be\n> compatible with the Python version you request.\n\n\n#### Static (Snapshot) Deployment\n\nBy default, `rsconnect` deploys the original notebook with all its source code. This\nenables the Posit Connect server to re-run the notebook upon request or on a schedule.\n\nIf you just want to publish an HTML snapshot of the notebook, you can use the `--static`\noption. This will cause `rsconnect` to execute your notebook locally to produce the HTML\nfile, then publish the HTML file to the Posit Connect server:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy notebook --static my-notebook.ipynb\n```\n\n### Creating a Manifest for Future Deployment\n\nYou can create a `manifest.json` file for a Jupyter Notebook, then use that manifest\nin a later deployment. Use the `write-manifest` command to do this.\n\nThe `write-manifest` command will also create a `requirements.txt` file, if it does\nnot already exist or the `--force-generate` option is specified. It will contain the\npackage dependencies from the current Python environment, or from an alternative\nPython executable specified in the `--python` option.\n\nHere is an example of the `write-manifest` command:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect write-manifest notebook my-notebook.ipynb\n```\n\n> **Note**\n> Manifests for static (pre-rendered) notebooks cannot be created.\n\n### API/Application Deployment Options\n\nYou can deploy a variety of APIs and applications using sub-commands of the\n`rsconnect deploy` command.\n\n* `api`: WSGI-compliant APIs (e.g., `bottle`, `falcon`, `flask`, `flask-restx`, `flasgger`, `pycnic`).\n* `flask`: Flask APIs (_Note: `flask` is an alias of `api`._).\n* `fastapi`: ASGI-compliant APIs (e.g, `fastapi`, `quart`, `sanic`, `starlette`)\n* `dash`: Python Dash apps\n* `streamlit`: Streamlit apps\n* `bokeh`: Bokeh server apps\n* `gradio`: Gradio apps\n\nAll options below apply equally to the `api`, `fastapi`, `dash`, `streamlit`,\n`gradio`, and `bokeh` sub-commands.\n\n#### Including Extra Files\n\nYou can include extra files in the deployment bundle to make them available when your\nAPI or application is run by the Posit Connect server. Just specify them on the\ncommand line after the API or application directory:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy api flask-api/ data.csv\n```\n\nSince deploying an API or application starts at a directory level, there will be times\nwhen some files under that directory subtree should not be included in the deployment\nor manifest. Use the `--exclude` option to specify files or directories to exclude.\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy dash --exclude dash-app-venv --exclude TODO.txt dash-app/\n```\n\nYou can exclude a directory by naming it:\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy dash --exclude dash-app-venv --exclude output/ dash-app/\n```\n\nThe `--exclude` option may be repeated, and may include a glob pattern.\nYou should always quote a glob pattern so that it will be passed to `rsconnect` as-is\ninstead of letting the shell expand it. If a file is specifically listed as an extra\nfile that also matches an exclusion pattern, the file will still be included in the\ndeployment (i.e., extra files take precedence).\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy dash --exclude dash-app-venv --exclude “*.txt” dash-app/\n```\n\nThe following shows an example of an extra file taking precedence:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy dash --exclude “*.csv” dash-app/ important_data.csv\n```\n\nThe \"`**`\" glob pattern will recursively match all files and directories,\nwhile \"`*`\" only matches files. The \"`**`\" pattern is useful with complicated\nproject hierarchies where enumerating the _included_ files is simpler than\nlisting the _exclusions_.\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy quarto . _quarto.yml index.qmd requirements.txt --exclude \"**\"\n```\n\nSome directories are excluded by default, to prevent bundling and uploading files that are not needed or might interfere with the deployment process:\n\n```\n.Rproj.user\n.env\n.git\n.svn\n.venv\n__pycache__\nenv\npackrat\nrenv\nrsconnect-python\nrsconnect\nvenv\n```\n\nAny directory that appears to be a Python virtual environment (by containing\n`bin/python`) will also be excluded.\n\n\n#### Package Dependencies\n\nIf a `requirements.txt` file exists in the API/application directory, it will be\nincluded in the bundle. It must specify the package dependencies needed to execute\nthe API or application. Posit Connect will reconstruct the Python environment using\nthe specified package list.\n\nIf there is no `requirements.txt` file or the `--force-generate` option is specified,\nthe package dependencies will be determined from the current Python environment, or\nfrom an alternative Python executable specified via the `--python` option:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy api --python /path/to/python my-api/\n```\n\nYou can see the packages list that will be included by running `pip list --format=freeze` yourself,\nensuring that you use the same Python that you use to run your API or application:\n\n```bash\n/path/to/python -m pip list --format=freeze\n```\n\n#### Python Version\n\nWhen deploying Python content to Posit Connect,\nthe server will require matching `<MAJOR.MINOR>` versions of Python. For example,\na server with only Python 3.9 installed will fail to match content deployed with\nPython 3.8. Your administrator may also enable exact Python version matching which\nwill be stricter and require matching major, minor, and patch versions. For more\ninformation see the [Posit Connect Admin Guide chapter titled Python Version\nMatching](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/python/#python-version-matching).\n\nWe recommend installing a version of Python on your client that is also available\nin your Connect installation. If that's not possible, you can override\nrsconnect-python's detected Python version and request a version of Python\nthat is installed in Connect, For example, this command:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy api --override-python-version 3.11.5 my-api/\n```\n\nwill deploy the content in `my-api` while requesting that Connect\nuse Python version 3.11.5.\n\n> **Note**\n> The packages and package versions listed in `requirements.txt` must be\n> compatible with the Python version you request.\n\n### Creating a Manifest for Future Deployment\n\nYou can create a `manifest.json` file for an API or application, then use that\nmanifest in a later deployment. Use the `write-manifest` command to do this.\n\nThe `write-manifest` command will also create a `requirements.txt` file, if it does\nnot already exist or the `--force-generate` option is specified. It will contain\nthe package dependencies from the current Python environment, or from an alternative\nPython executable specified in the `--python` option.\n\nHere is an example of the `write-manifest` command:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect write-manifest api my-api/\n```\n\n### Deploying R or Other Content\n\nYou can deploy other content that has an existing Posit Connect `manifest.json`\nfile. For example, if you download and unpack a source bundle from Posit Connect,\nyou can deploy the resulting directory. The options are similar to notebook or\nAPI/application deployment; see `rsconnect deploy manifest --help` for details.\n\nHere is an example of the `deploy manifest` command:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy manifest /path/to/manifest.json\n```\n\n> **Note**\n> In this case, the existing content is deployed as-is. Python environment\n> inspection and notebook pre-rendering, if needed, are assumed to be done already\n> and represented in the manifest.\n\nThe argument to `deploy manifest` may also be a directory so long as that directory\ncontains a `manifest.json` file.\n\nIf you have R content but don't have a `manifest.json` file, you can use the RStudio\nIDE to create the manifest. See the help for the `rsconnect::writeManifest` R function:\n\n```r\ninstall.packages('rsconnect')\nlibrary(rsconnect)\n?rsconnect::writeManifest\n```\n\n### Options for All Types of Deployments\n\nThese options apply to any type of content deployment.\n\n#### Title\n\nThe title of the deployed content is, by default, derived from the filename. For\nexample, if you deploy `my-notebook.ipynb`, the title will be `my-notebook`. To change\nthis, use the `--title` option:\n\n```\nrsconnect deploy notebook --title \"My Notebook\" my-notebook.ipynb\n```\n\nWhen using `rsconnect deploy api`, `rsconnect deploy fastapi`, `rsconnect deploy dash`,\n`rsconnect deploy streamlit`, `rsconnect deploy bokeh`, or `rsconnect deploy gradio`,\nthe title is derived from the directory containing the API or application.\n\nWhen using `rsconnect deploy manifest`, the title is derived from the primary\nfilename referenced in the manifest.\n\n#### Verification After Deployment\nAfter deploying your content, rsconnect accesses the deployed content\nto verify that the deployment is live. This is done with a `GET` request\nto the content, without parameters. The request is\nconsidered successful if there isn't a 5xx code returned. Errors like\n400 Bad Request or 405 Method Not Allowed because not all apps support `GET /`.\nFor cases where this is not desired, use the `--no-verify` flag on the command line.\n\n### Environment variables\nYou can set environment variables during deployment. Their names and values will be\npassed to Posit Connect during deployment so you can use them in your code. Note that\nif you are using `rsconnect` to deploy to shinyapps.io, environment variable management\nis not supported on that platform.\n\nFor example, if `notebook.ipynb` contains\n```python\nprint(os.environ[\"MYVAR\"])\n```\n\nYou can set the value of `MYVAR` that will be set when your code runs in Posit Connect\nusing the `-E/--environment` option:\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy notebook --environment MYVAR='hello world' notebook.ipynb\n```\n\nTo avoid exposing sensitive values on the command line, you can specify\na variable without a value. In this case, it will use the value from the\nenvironment in which rsconnect-python is running:\n```bash\nexport SECRET_KEY=12345\n\nrsconnect deploy notebook --environment SECRET_KEY notebook.ipynb\n```\n\nIf you specify environment variables when updating an existing deployment,\nnew values will be set for the variables you provided. Other variables will\nremain unchanged. If you don't specify any variables, all of the existing\nvariables will remain unchanged.\n\nEnvironment variables are set on the content item before the content bundle\nis uploaded and deployed. If the deployment fails, the new environment variables\nwill still take effect.\n\n### Network Options\n\nWhen specifying information that `rsconnect` needs to be able to interact with Posit\nConnect, you can tailor how transport layer security is performed.\n\n#### TLS/SSL Certificates\n\nPosit Connect servers can be configured to use TLS/SSL. If your server's certificate\nis trusted by your Jupyter Notebook server, API client or user's browser, then you\ndon't need to do anything special. You can test this out with the `details` command:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect details \\\n    --api-key my-api-key \\\n    --server https://connect.example.org:3939\n```\n\nIf this fails with a TLS Certificate Validation error, then you have two options.\n\n* Provide the Root CA certificate that is at the root of the signing chain for your\n  Posit Connect server. This will enable `rsconnect` to securely validate the\n  server's TLS certificate.\n\n    ```bash\n    rsconnect details \\\n        --api-key my-api-key \\\n        --server https://connect.example.org \\\n        --cacert /path/to/certificate.pem\n    ```\n\n* Posit Connect is in \"insecure mode\". This disables TLS certificate verification,\n  which results in a less secure connection.\n\n    ```bash\n    rsconnect add \\\n        --api-key my-api-key \\\n        --server https://connect.example.org \\\n        --insecure\n    ```\n\nOnce you work out the combination of options that allow you to successfully work with\nan instance of Posit Connect, you'll probably want to use the `add` command to have\n`rsconnect` remember those options and allow you to just use a nickname.\n\n### Updating a Deployment\n\nIf you deploy a file again to the same server, `rsconnect` will update the previous\ndeployment. This means that you can keep running `rsconnect deploy notebook my-notebook.ipynb`\nas you develop new versions of your notebook. The same applies to other Python content\ntypes.\n\n#### Forcing a New Deployment\n\nTo bypass this behavior and force a new deployment, use the `--new` option:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy dash --new my-app/\n```\n\n#### Updating a Different Deployment\n\nIf you want to update an existing deployment but don't have the saved deployment data,\nyou can provide the app's numeric ID or GUID on the command line:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy notebook --app-id 123456 my-notebook.ipynb\n```\n\nYou must be the owner of the target deployment, or a collaborator with permission to\nchange the content. The type of content (static notebook, notebook with source code,\nAPI, or application) must match the existing deployment.\n\n> **Note**\n> There is no confirmation required to update a deployment. If you do so\n> accidentally, use the \"Source Versions\" dialog in the Posit Connect dashboard to\n> activate the previous version and remove the erroneous one.\n\n##### Finding the App ID\n\nThe App ID associated with a piece of content you have previously deployed from the\n`rsconnect` command line interface can be found easily by querying the deployment\ninformation using the `info` command. For more information, see the\n[Showing the Deployment Information](#showing-the-deployment-information) section.\n\nIf the content was deployed elsewhere or `info` does not return the correct App ID,\nbut you can open the content on Posit Connect, find the content and open it in a\nbrowser. The URL in your browser's location bar will contain `#/apps/NNN` where `NNN`\nis your App ID. The GUID identifier for the app may be found on the **Info** tab for\nthe content in the Posit Connect UI.\n\n#### Showing the Deployment Information\n\nYou can see the information that the `rsconnect` command has saved for the most recent\ndeployment with the `info` command:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect info my-notebook.ipynb\n```\n\nIf you have deployed to multiple servers, the most recent deployment information for\neach server will be shown. This command also displays the path to the file where the\ndeployment data is stored.\n\n## Stored Information Files\n\nStored information files are stored in a platform-specific directory:\n\n| Platform | Location                                                           |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Mac      | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/rsconnect-python/`              |\n| Linux    | `$HOME/.rsconnect-python/` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rsconnect-python/` |\n| Windows  | `$APPDATA/rsconnect-python`                                        |\n\nRemembered server information is stored in the `servers.json` file in that directory.\n\n### Deployment Data\n\nAfter a deployment is completed, information about the deployment is saved\nto enable later redeployment. This data is stored alongside the deployed file,\nin an `rsconnect-python` subdirectory, if possible. If that location is not writable\nduring deployment, then the deployment data will be stored in the global configuration\ndirectory specified above.\n\n<div style=\"display:none\">\nGenerated from <code>rsconnect-python {{ rsconnect_python.version }}</code>\n</div>\n\n### Hide Jupyter Notebook Input Code Cells\n\nThe user can render a Jupyter notebook without its corresponding input code cells by passing the '--hide-all-input' flag through the cli:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy notebook \\\n    --server https://connect.example.org \\\n    --api-key my-api-key \\\n    --hide-all-input \\\n    my-notebook.ipynb\n```\n\nTo selectively hide input cells in a Jupyter notebook, the user needs to follow a two step process:\n1. tag cells with the 'hide_input' tag,\n2. then pass the ' --hide-tagged-input' flag through the cli:\n\n```bash\nrsconnect deploy notebook \\\n    --server https://connect.example.org \\\n    --api-key my-api-key \\\n    --hide-tagged-input \\\n    my-notebook.ipynb\n```\n\nBy default, rsconnect-python does not install Jupyter notebook related depenencies. These dependencies are installed via rsconnect-jupyter. When the user is using the hide input features in rsconnect-python by itself without rsconnect-jupyter, he/she needs to install the following package depenecies:\n\n```\nnotebook\nnbformat\nnbconvert>=5.6.1\n```\n\n## Content subcommands\n\nrsconnect-python supports multiple options for interacting with Posit Connect's\n`/v1/content` API. Both administrators and publishers can use the content subcommands\nto search, download, and rebuild content on Posit Connect without needing to access the\ndashboard from a browser.\n\n> **Note**\n> The `rsconnect content` CLI subcommands are intended to be easily scriptable.\n> The default output format is `JSON` so that the results can be easily piped into\n> other command line utilities like [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for further post-processing.\n\n```bash\nrsconnect content --help\n# Usage: rsconnect content [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n#   Interact with Posit Connect's content API.\n\n# Options:\n#   --help  Show this message and exit.\n\n# Commands:\n#   build            Build content on Posit Connect.\n#   describe         Describe a content item on Posit Connect.\n#   download-bundle  Download a content item's source bundle.\n#   search           Search for content on Posit Connect.\n```\n\n### Content Search\n\nThe `rsconnect content search` subcommands can be used by administrators and publishers\nto find specific content on a given Posit Connect server. The search returns\nmetadata for each content item that meets the search criteria.\n\n```bash\nrsconnect content search --help\n# Usage: rsconnect content search [OPTIONS]\n\n# Options:\n#   -n, --name TEXT                 The nickname of the Posit Connect server.\n#   -s, --server TEXT               The URL for the Posit Connect server.\n#   -k, --api-key TEXT              The API key to use to authenticate with\n#                                   Posit Connect.\n\n#   -i, --insecure                  Disable TLS certification/host validation.\n#   -c, --cacert FILENAME           The path to trusted TLS CA certificates.\n#   --published                     Search only published content.\n#   --unpublished                   Search only unpublished content.\n#   --content-type [unknown|shiny|rmd-static|rmd-shiny|static|api|tensorflow-saved-model|jupyter-static|python-api|python-dash|python-streamlit|python-bokeh|python-fastapi|python-gradio|quarto-shiny|quarto-static]\n#                                   Filter content results by content type.\n#   --r-version VERSIONSEARCHFILTER\n#                                   Filter content results by R version.\n#   --py-version VERSIONSEARCHFILTER\n#                                   Filter content results by Python version.\n#   --title-contains TEXT           Filter content results by title.\n#   --order-by [created|last_deployed]\n#                                   Order content results.\n#   -v, --verbose                   Print detailed messages.\n#   --help                          Show this message and exit.\n\nrsconnect content search\n# [\n#   {\n#     \"max_conns_per_process\": null,\n#     \"content_category\": \"\",\n#     \"load_factor\": null,\n#     \"cluster_name\": \"Local\",\n#     \"description\": \"\",\n#     \"bundle_id\": \"142\",\n#     \"image_name\": null,\n#     \"r_version\": null,\n#     \"content_url\": \"https://connect.example.org:3939/content/4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317/\",\n#     \"connection_timeout\": null,\n#     \"min_processes\": null,\n#     \"last_deployed_time\": \"2021-12-02T18:09:11Z\",\n#     \"name\": \"logs-api-python\",\n#     \"title\": \"logs-api-python\",\n#     \"created_time\": \"2021-07-19T19:17:32Z\",\n#     \"read_timeout\": null,\n#     \"guid\": \"4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317\",\n#     \"parameterized\": false,\n#     \"run_as\": null,\n#     \"py_version\": \"3.8.2\",\n#     \"idle_timeout\": null,\n#     \"app_role\": \"owner\",\n#     \"access_type\": \"acl\",\n#     \"app_mode\": \"python-api\",\n#     \"init_timeout\": null,\n#     \"id\": \"18\",\n#     \"quarto_version\": null,\n#     \"dashboard_url\": \"https://connect.example.org:3939/connect/#/apps/4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317\",\n#     \"run_as_current_user\": false,\n#     \"owner_guid\": \"edf26318-0027-4d9d-bbbb-54703ebb1855\",\n#     \"max_processes\": null\n#   },\n#   ...\n# ]\n```\n\nSee [this section](#searching-for-content) for more comprehensive usage examples\nof the available search flags.\n\n\n### Content Build\n\n> **Note**\n> The `rsconnect content build` subcommand requires Posit Connect >= 2021.11.1\n\nPosit Connect caches R and Python packages in the configured\n[`Server.DataDir`](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/appendix/configuration/#Server.DataDir).\nUnder certain circumstances (examples below), these package caches can become stale\nand need to be rebuilt. This refresh automatically occurs when a Posit Connect\nuser visits the content. You may wish to refresh some content before it is visited\nbecause it is high priority or is not visited frequently (API content, emailed reports).\nIn these cases, it is possible to preemptively build specific content items using\nthe `rsconnect content build` subcommands. This way the user does not have to pay\nthe build cost when the content is accessed next.\n\nThe following are some common scenarios where performing a content build might be necessary:\n\n- OS upgrade\n- changes to gcc or libc libraries\n- changes to Python or R installations\n- switching from source to binary package repositories or vice versa\n\n> **Note**\n> The `content build` command is non-destructive, meaning that it does nothing to purge\n> existing packrat/python package caches before a build. If you have an\n> existing cache, it should be cleared prior to starting a content build.\n> See the [migration documentation](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/appendix/cli/#migration) for details.\n\n> **Note**\n> You may use the [`rsconnect content search`](#content-search) subcommand to help\n> identify high priority content items to build.\n\n```bash\nrsconnect content build --help\nUsage: rsconnect content build [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n  Build content on Posit Connect. Requires Connect >= 2021.11.1\n\nOptions:\n  --help  Show this message and exit.\n\nCommands:\n  add      Mark a content item for build. Use `build run` to invoke the build\n           on the Connect server.\n\n  history  Get the build history for a content item.\n  logs     Print the logs for a content build.\n  ls       List the content items that are being tracked for build on a given\n           Connect server.\n\n  rm       Remove a content item from the list of content that are tracked for\n           build. Use `build ls` to view the tracked content.\n\n  run      Start building content on a given Connect server.\n```\n\nTo build a specific content item, first `add` it to the list of content that is\n\"tracked\" for building using its GUID. Content that is \"tracked\" in the local state\nmay become out-of-sync with what exists remotely on the Connect server (the result of\n`rsconnect content search`). When this happens, it is safe to remove the locally tracked\nentries with `rsconnect content build rm`.\n\n> **Note**\n> Metadata for \"tracked\" content items is stored in a local directory called\n> `rsconnect-build` which will be automatically created in your current working directory.\n> You may set the environment variable `CONNECT_CONTENT_BUILD_DIR` to override this directory location.\n\n```bash\n# `add` the content to mark it as \"tracked\"\nrsconnect content build add --guid 4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317\n\n# run the build which kicks off a cache rebuild on the server\nrsconnect content build run\n\n# once the build is complete, the content can be \"untracked\"\n# this does not remove the content from the Connect server\n# the entry is only removed from the local state file\nrsconnect content build rm --guid 4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317\n```\n\n> **Note**\n> See [this section](#add-to-build-from-search-results) for\n> an example of how to add multiple content items in bulk, from the results\n> of a `rsconnect content search` command.\n\nTo view all currently \"tracked\" content items, use the `rsconnect content build ls` subcommand.\n\n```bash\nrsconnect content build ls\n```\n\nTo view only the \"tracked\" content items that have not yet been built, use the `--status NEEDS_BUILD` flag.\n\n```bash\nrsconnect content build ls --status NEEDS_BUILD\n```\n\nOnce the content items have been added, you may initiate a build\nusing the `rsconnect content build run` subcommand. This command will attempt to\nbuild all \"tracked\" content that has the status `NEEDS_BUILD`.\n\n> To re-run failed builds, use `rsconnect content build run --retry`. This will build\nall tracked content in any of the following states: `[NEEDS_BUILD, ABORTED, ERROR, RUNNING]`.\n>\n> If you encounter an error indicating that a build operation is already in progress,\nyou can use `rsconnect content build run --force` to bypass the check and proceed with building content marked as `NEEDS_BUILD`.\nEnsure no other build operation is actively running before using the `--force` option.\n\n```bash\nrsconnect content build run\n# [INFO] 2021-12-14T13:02:45-0500 Initializing ContentBuildStore for https://connect.example.org:3939\n# [INFO] 2021-12-14T13:02:45-0500 Starting content build (https://connect.example.org:3939)...\n# [INFO] 2021-12-14T13:02:45-0500 Starting build: 4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317\n# [INFO] 2021-12-14T13:02:50-0500 Running = 1, Pending = 0, Success = 0, Error = 0\n# [INFO] 2021-12-14T13:02:50-0500 Build succeeded: 4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317\n# [INFO] 2021-12-14T13:02:55-0500 Running = 0, Pending = 0, Success = 1, Error = 0\n# [INFO] 2021-12-14T13:02:55-0500 1/1 content builds completed in 0:00:10\n# [INFO] 2021-12-14T13:02:55-0500 Success = 1, Error = 0\n# [INFO] 2021-12-14T13:02:55-0500 Content build complete.\n```\n\nSometimes content builds will fail and require debugging by the publisher or administrator.\nUse the `rsconnect content build ls` to identify content builds that resulted in errors\nand inspect the build logs with the `rsconnect content build logs` subcommand.\n\n```bash\nrsconnect content build ls --status ERROR\n# [INFO] 2021-12-14T13:07:32-0500 Initializing ContentBuildStore for https://connect.example.org:3939\n# [\n#   {\n#     \"rsconnect_build_status\": \"ERROR\",\n#     \"last_deployed_time\": \"2021-12-02T18:09:11Z\",\n#     \"owner_guid\": \"edf26318-0027-4d9d-bbbb-54703ebb1855\",\n#     \"rsconnect_last_build_log\": \"/Users/david/code/posit/rsconnect-python/rsconnect-build/logs/connect_example_org_3939/4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317/pZoqfBoi6BgpKde5.log\",\n#     \"guid\": \"4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317\",\n#     \"rsconnect_build_task_result\": {\n#       \"user_id\": 1,\n#       \"error\": \"Cannot find compatible environment: no compatible Local environment with Python version 3.9.5\",\n#       \"code\": 1,\n#       \"finished\": true,\n#       \"result\": {\n#         \"data\": \"An error occurred while building the content\",\n#         \"type\": \"build-failed-error\"\n#       },\n#       \"id\": \"pZoqfBoi6BgpKde5\"\n#     },\n#     \"dashboard_url\": \"https://connect.example.org:3939/connect/#/apps/4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317\",\n#     \"name\": \"logs-api-python\",\n#     \"title\": \"logs-api-python\",\n#     \"content_url\": \"https://connect.example.org:3939/content/4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317/\",\n#     \"bundle_id\": \"141\",\n#     \"rsconnect_last_build_time\": \"2021-12-14T18:07:16Z\",\n#     \"created_time\": \"2021-07-19T19:17:32Z\",\n#     \"app_mode\": \"python-api\"\n#   }\n# ]\n\nrsconnect content build logs --guid 4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317\n# [INFO] 2021-12-14T13:09:27-0500 Initializing ContentBuildStore for https://connect.example.org:3939\n# Building Python API...\n# Cannot find compatible environment: no compatible Local environment with Python version 3.9.5\n# Task failed. Task exited with status 1.\n```\n\nOnce a build for a piece of tracked content is complete, it can be safely removed from the list of \"tracked\"\ncontent by using `rsconnect content build rm` command. This command accepts a `--guid` argument to specify\nwhich piece of content to remove. Removing the content from the list of tracked content simply removes the item\nfrom the local state file, the content deployed to the server remains unchanged.\n\n```bash\nrsconnect content build rm --guid 4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317\n```\n\n### Rebuilding lots of content\n\nWhen attempting to rebuild a long list of content, it is recommended to first build a sub-set of the content list.\nFirst choose 1 or 2 Python and R content items for each version of Python and R on the server. Try to choose content\nitems that have the most dependencies in common with other content items on the server. Build these content items\nfirst with the `rsconnect content build run` command. This will \"warm\" the Python and R environment cache for subsequent\ncontent builds. Once these initial builds are complete, add the remaining content items to the list of \"tracked\" content\nand execute another `rsconnect content build run` command.\n\nTo execute multiple content builds simultaniously, use the `rsconnect content build run --parallelism` flag to increase the\nnumber of concurrent builds. By default, each content item is built serially. Increasing the build parallelism can reduce the total\ntime needed to rebuild a long list of content items. We recommend starting with a low parallelism setting (2-3) and increasing\nfrom there to avoid overloading the Connect server with concurrent build operations. Remember that these builds are executing on the\nConnect server which consumes CPU, RAM, and i/o bandwidth that would otherwise we allocated for Python and R applications\nrunning on the server.\n\n## Common Usage Examples\n\n### Searching for content\n\nThe following are some examples of how publishers might use the\n`rsconnect content search` subcommand to find content on Posit Connect.\nBy default, the `rsconnect content search` command will return metadata for ALL\nof the content on a Posit Connect server, both published and unpublished content.\n\n> **Note**\n> When using the `--r-version` and `--py-version` flags, users should\n> make sure to quote the arguments to avoid conflicting with your shell. For\n> example, bash would interpret `--py-version >3.0.0` as a shell redirect because of the\n> unquoted `>` character.\n\n```bash\n# return only published content\nrsconnect content search --published\n\n# return only unpublished content\nrsconnect content search --unpublished\n\n# return published content where the python version is at least 3.9.0\nrsconnect content search --published --py-version \">=3.9.0\"\n\n# return published content where the R version is exactly 3.6.3\nrsconnect content search --published --r-version \"==3.6.3\"\n\n# return published content where the content type is a static RMD\nrsconnect content search --content-type rmd-static\n\n# return published content where the content type is either shiny OR fast-api\nrsconnect content search --content-type shiny --content-type python-fastapi\n\n# return all content, published or unpublished, where the title contains the\n# text \"Stock Report\"\nrsconnect content search --title-contains \"Stock Report\"\n\n# return published content, results are ordered by when the content was last\n# deployed\nrsconnect content search --published --order-by last_deployed\n\n# return published content, results are ordered by when the content was\n# created\nrsconnect content search --published --order-by created\n```\n\n### Finding r and python versions\n\nOne common use for the `search` command might be to find the versions of\nr and python that are currently in use on your Posit Connect server before a migration.\n\n```bash\n# search for all published content and print the unique r and python version\n# combinations\nrsconnect content search --published | jq -c '.[] | {py_version,r_version}' | sort |\nuniq\n# {\"py_version\":\"3.8.2\",\"r_version\":\"3.5.3\"}\n# {\"py_version\":\"3.8.2\",\"r_version\":\"3.6.3\"}\n# {\"py_version\":\"3.8.2\",\"r_version\":null}\n# {\"py_version\":null,\"r_version\":\"3.5.3\"}\n# {\"py_version\":null,\"r_version\":\"3.6.3\"}\n# {\"py_version\":null,\"r_version\":null}\n```\n\n### Finding recently deployed content\n\n```bash\n# return only the 10 most recently deployed content items\nrsconnect content search \\\n    --order-by last_deployed \\\n    --published | jq -c 'limit(10; .[]) | { guid, last_deployed_time }'\n# {\"guid\":\"4ffc819c-065c-420c-88eb-332db1133317\",\"last_deployed_time\":\"2021-12-02T18:09:11Z\"}\n# {\"guid\":\"aa2603f8-1988-484f-a335-193f2c57e6c4\",\"last_deployed_time\":\"2021-12-01T20:56:07Z\"}\n# {\"guid\":\"051252f0-4f70-438f-9be1-d818a3b5f8d9\",\"last_deployed_time\":\"2021-12-01T20:37:01Z\"}\n# {\"guid\":\"015143da-b75f-407c-81b1-99c4a724341e\",\"last_deployed_time\":\"2021-11-30T16:56:21Z\"}\n# {\"guid\":\"bcc74209-3a81-4b9c-acd5-d24a597c256c\",\"last_deployed_time\":\"2021-11-30T15:51:07Z\"}\n# {\"guid\":\"f21d7767-c99e-4dd4-9b00-ff8ec9ae2f53\",\"last_deployed_time\":\"2021-11-23T18:46:28Z\"}\n# {\"guid\":\"da4f709c-c383-4fbc-89e2-f032b2d7e91d\",\"last_deployed_time\":\"2021-11-23T18:46:28Z\"}\n# {\"guid\":\"9180809d-38fd-4730-a0e0-8568c45d87b7\",\"last_deployed_time\":\"2021-11-23T15:16:19Z\"}\n# {\"guid\":\"2b1d2ab8-927d-4956-bbf9-29798d039bc5\",\"last_deployed_time\":\"2021-11-22T18:33:17Z\"}\n# {\"guid\":\"c96db3f3-87a1-4df5-9f58-eb109c397718\",\"last_deployed_time\":\"2021-11-19T20:25:33Z\"}\n```\n\n### Add to build from search results\n\nOne common use case might be to `rsconnect content build add` content for build\nbased on the results of a `rsconnect content search`. For example:\n\n```bash\n# search for all API type content, then\n# for each guid, add it to the \"tracked\" content items\nfor guid in $(rsconnect content search \\\n        --published \\\n        --content-type python-api \\\n        --content-type api | jq -r '.[].guid'); do\n    rsconnect content build add --guid $guid\ndone\n```\n\nAdding content items one at a time can be a slow operation. This is because\n`rsconnect content build add` must fetch metadata for each content item before it\nis added to the \"tracked\" content items. By providing multiple `--guid` arguments\nto the `rsconnect content build add` subcommand, we can fetch metadata for multiple content items\nin a single api call, which speeds up the operation significantly.\n\n```bash\n# write the guid of every published content item to a file called guids.txt\nrsconnect content search --published | jq '.[].guid' > guids.txt\n\n# bulk-add from the guids.txt with a single `rsconnect content build add` command\nxargs printf -- '-g %s\\n' < guids.txt | xargs rsconnect content build add\n```\n## Programmatic Provisioning\n\nPosit Connect supports the programmatic bootstrapping of an administrator API key\nfor scripted provisioning tasks. This process is supported by the `rsconnect bootstrap` command,\nwhich uses a JSON Web Token to request an initial API key from a fresh Connect instance.\n\n```bash\nrsconnect bootstrap \\\n    --server https://connect.example.org:3939 \\\n    --jwt-keypath /path/to/secret.key\n```\n\nA full description on how to use `rsconnect bootstrap` in a provisioning workflow is provided in the Connect administrator guide's\n[programmatic provisioning](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/programmatic-provisioning) documentation.\n\n## Server Administration Tasks\n\nStarting with the 2023.05 edition of Posit Connect, `rsconnect-python` can be\nused to perform certain server administration tasks, such as instance managing\nruntime caches. For more information on runtime caches in Posit Connect, see the\nConnect Admin Guide's section on [runtime\ncaches](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/server-management/runtime-caches/).\n\nExamples in this section will use `--name myserver` to stand in for your Connect\nserver information. See [Managing Server\nInformation](#managing-server-information) above for more details.\n\n### Enumerate Runtime Caches\n*New in Connect 2023.05*\n\nUse the command below to enumerate runtime caches on a Connect server. The\ncommand will output a JSON object containing a list of runtime caches . Each\ncache entry will contain the following information:\n\n- `language`: The language of content that uses the cache, either R or Python.\n- `version`: The language version of the content that uses the cache.\n- `image_name`: The execution environment of the cache. The string `Local`\n  denotes native execution. For Connect instances that use off-host execution,\n  the name of the image that uses the cache will be displayed.\n\n```bash\nrsconnect system caches list --name myserver\n# {\n#   \"caches\": [\n#     {\n#       \"language\": \"R\",\n#       \"version\": \"3.6.3\",\n#       \"image_name\": \"Local\"\n#     },\n#     {\n#       \"language\": \"Python\",\n#       \"version\": \"3.9.5\",\n#       \"image_name\": \"Local\"\n#     },\n#         {\n#       \"language\": \"R\",\n#       \"version\": \"3.6.3\",\n#       \"image_name\": \"rstudio/content-base:r3.6.3-py3.9.5-bionic\"\n#     },\n#     {\n#       \"language\": \"Python\",\n#       \"version\": \"3.9.5\",\n#       \"image_name\": \"rstudio/content-base:r3.6.3-py3.9.5-bionic\"\n#     }\n#   ]\n# }\n```\n\n> **Note**\n> The `image_name` field returned by the server will use sanitized versions\n> of names.\n\n### Delete Runtime Caches\n*New in Connect 2023.05*\n\nWhen Connect's execution environment changes, runtime caches may be invalidated.\nIn these cases, you will need to delete the affected runtime caches using the\n`system caches delete` command.\n\n> **Warning**\n> After deleting a cache, the first time affected content is visited, Connect\n> will need to reconstruct its environment. This can take a long time. To\n> mitigate this, you can use the [`content build`](#content-build) command to\n> rebuild affected content ahead of time. You may want to do this just for\n> high-priority content, or for all content.\n\nTo delete a runtime cache, call the `system caches delete` command, specifying a\nConnect server, as well as the language (`-l, --language`), version (`-V,\n--version`), and image name (`-I, --image-name`) for the cache you wish to\ndelete. Deleting a large cache might take a while.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  ### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  **0.** This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.  **1.** You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  **2.** You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:   **a)** You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.   **b)** You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.   **c)** If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.  **3.** You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:   **a)** Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,   **b)** Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,   **c)** Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  **4.** You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  **5.** You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.  **6.** Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.  **7.** If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  **8.** If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  **9.** The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  **10.** If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  **NO WARRANTY**  **11.** BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  **12.** IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  ### END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  ### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.  The hypothetical commands \\`show w' and \\`show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than \\`show w' and \\`show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.  signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the [GNU Lesser General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html) instead of this License.
