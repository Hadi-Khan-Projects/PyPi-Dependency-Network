Syne Tune runs with minimal dependencies.\n* **Wide coverage of different HPO methods**: Syne Tune supports more than 20 different optimization methods across [multi-fidelity HPO](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/multifidelity/README.html), [constrained HPO](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/basics/basics_outlook.html#further-topics), [multi-objective HPO](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#supported-multi-objective-optimization-methods), [transfer learning](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/transfer_learning/transfer_learning.html), [cost-aware HPO](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_apidoc/syne_tune.optimizer.schedulers.searchers.cost_aware.html), and [population-based training](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_apidoc/syne_tune.optimizer.schedulers.pbt.html).\n* **Simple, modular design**: Rather than wrapping other HPO\n  frameworks, Syne Tune provides simple APIs and scheduler templates, which can\n  easily be [extended to your specific needs](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/developer/README.html).\n  Studying the code will allow you to understand what the different algorithms\n  are doing, and how they differ from each other.\n* **Industry-strength Bayesian optimization**: Syne Tune has comprehensive support\n  for [Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/basics/basics_bayesopt.html).\n  The same code powers modalities such as multi-fidelity HPO, constrained HPO, and\n  cost-aware HPO, and has been tried and tested in production for several years.\n* **Support for distributed workloads**: Syne Tune lets you move fast, thanks to the parallel compute resources AWS SageMaker offers. Syne Tune allows ML/AI practitioners to easily set up and run studies with many [experiments running in parallel](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/experimentation/README.html). Run on different compute environments (locally, AWS, simulation) by changing just one line of code.\n* **Out-of-the-box tabulated benchmarks:** Tabulated benchmarks let you simulate results in seconds while preserving the real dynamics of asynchronous or synchronous HPO with any number of workers.\n\n\nSyne Tune is developed in collaboration with the team behind the [Automatic Model Tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning.html) service.\n\n\n## Installing\n\nTo install Syne Tune from pip, you can simply do:\n\n```bash\npip install 'syne-tune[basic]'\n```\n\nor to install the latest version from source: \n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/awslabs/syne-tune.git\ncd syne-tune\npython3 -m venv st_venv\n. st_venv/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install -e '.[basic]'\n```\n\nThis installs everything in a virtual environment `st_venv`. Remember to activate\nthis environment before working with Syne Tune. We also recommend building the\nvirtual environment from scratch now and then, in particular when you pull a new\nrelease, as dependencies may have changed.\n\nSee our [change log](CHANGELOG.md) to see what changed in the latest version. \n\n## Getting started\n\nTo enable tuning, you have to report metrics from a training script so that they can be communicated later to Syne Tune,\nthis can be accomplished by just calling `report(epoch=epoch, loss=loss)` as shown in the example below:\n\n```python\n# train_height_simple.py\nimport logging\nimport time\n\nfrom syne_tune import Reporter\nfrom argparse import ArgumentParser\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    root = logging.getLogger()\n    root.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n    parser = ArgumentParser()\n    parser.add_argument('--epochs', type=int)\n    parser.add_argument('--width', type=float)\n    parser.add_argument('--height', type=float)\n    args, _ = parser.parse_known_args()\n    report = Reporter()\n    for step in range(args.epochs):\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n        dummy_score = 1.0 / (0.1 + args.width * step / 100) + args.height * 0.1\n        # Feed the score back to Syne Tune.\n        report(epoch=step + 1, mean_loss=dummy_score)\n```\n\nOnce you have a training script reporting a metric, you can launch a tuning as follows:\n\n```python\n# launch_height_simple.py\nfrom syne_tune import Tuner, StoppingCriterion\nfrom syne_tune.backend import LocalBackend\nfrom syne_tune.config_space import randint\nfrom syne_tune.optimizer.baselines import ASHA\n\n# hyperparameter search space to consider\nconfig_space = {\n    'width': randint(1, 20),\n    'height': randint(1, 20),\n    'epochs': 100,\n}\n\ntuner = Tuner(\n    trial_backend=LocalBackend(entry_point='train_height_simple.py'),\n    scheduler=ASHA(\n        config_space,\n        metric='mean_loss',\n        resource_attr='epoch',\n        max_resource_attr=\"epochs\",\n        search_options={'debug_log': False},\n    ),\n    stop_criterion=StoppingCriterion(max_wallclock_time=30),\n    n_workers=4,  # how many trials are evaluated in parallel\n)\ntuner.run()\n```\n\nThe above example runs ASHA with 4 asynchronous workers on a local machine.\n\n## Experimentation with Syne Tune\n\nIf you plan to use advanced features of Syne Tune, such as different execution\nbackends or running experiments remotely, writing launcher scripts like\n`examples/launch_height_simple.py` can become tedious. Syne Tune provides an\nadvanced experimentation framework, which you can learn about in\n[this tutorial](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/experimentation/README.html)\nor also in\n[this one](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/odsc_tutorial/README.html).\n\n## Supported HPO methods\n\nThe following hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods are available in Syne Tune:\n\nMethod | Reference | Searcher | Asynchronous? | Multi-fidelity? | Transfer? \n:--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: \nGrid Search |  | deterministic | yes | no | no \nRandom Search | Bergstra, et al.

The original\nsource code for the paper is [here](https://github.com/releaunifreiburg/DyHPO/tree/main).\n\nThe searchers fall into four broad categories, **deterministic**, **random**, **evolutionary** and **model-based**. The random searchers sample candidate hyperparameter configurations uniformly at random, while the model-based searchers sample them non-uniformly at random, according to a model (e.g., Gaussian process, density ration estimator, etc.) and an acquisition function. The evolutionary searchers make use of an evolutionary algorithm.\n\nSyne Tune also supports [BoTorch](https://github.com/awslabs/syne-tune/blob/main/syne_tune/optimizer/schedulers/searchers/botorch/botorch_searcher.py) searchers.\n\n## Supported multi-objective optimization methods\n\nMethod |          Reference          |   Searcher   | Asynchronous? | Multi-fidelity? | Transfer?\n:--- |:---------------------------:|:------------:| :---: | :---: | :---: \nConstrained Bayesian Optimization |   Gardner, et al.
