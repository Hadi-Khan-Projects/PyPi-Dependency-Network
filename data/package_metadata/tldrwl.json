It can understand images and express logical ideas about them, making it a powerful tool for education and personalized learning. The development of GPT-4 has been focused on making it safer, more aligned, and more useful for society, with internal guardrails around adversarial usage, unwanted content, and privacy concerns. The partnership with Microsoft aims to shape this technology into something that's truly\nuseful for the world and can improve productivity, ultimately leading to a better quality of life. While limited, GPT-4 is an important step towards highly advanced and capable AI systems, and OpenAI hopes to make it useful to everyone, not just early adopters.\nEstimated cost (usd): $0.0016\n```\n\n## Features\n\n- [x] Summarize text with a single API call\n- [x] Summarize webpages with a single API call\n- [x] Summarize Youtube videos with a single API call\n- [ ] Summarize basic plain text file with a single API call\n- [ ] Summarize rich text file with a single API call\n- [ ] Summarize audio with a single API call\n- [x] Report number of tokens + cost per request\n- [x] Sync APIs\n- [x] Async APIs\n- [x] CLI\n- [x] CI/CD to publish to automatically PyPI\n\n## Caveats\n\n- Requires an OpenAI API key\n  - Export to env: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"<your api key here>\"`\n- Slow\n  - Small articles take ~20 seconds, longer articles and videos take a few minutes.
